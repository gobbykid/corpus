# Corpus
The corpus of texts on which the analyses of the GOBBYKID Project are based.

In particular, the main corpus is subdivided in two corpora: one containing the texts written by female authors and one containing the texts written for male authors.
The file names contain the date of the first publication of the work, the surname of the author, and then the title of the book.

All texts come from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and are encoded in UTF-8.
